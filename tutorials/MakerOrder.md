# What is a Maker Order? [WIP]

**TLDR:** A Maker order is an order with no active takers, therefore it "Makes" its own order to be fufilled at a later date. 

### Description
When a user places an order, if no one immediatley agrees to the terms of the order, the order is considered a Maker order. 

* There are no existing orders in the orderbook that fufill the user's criteria so they decide to "make" their own order.
* The user submitted order is added to the Algodex Orderbook 
* The order is now visible to other users of Algodex and fufills when another user agrees to "take" the order
